## JSON Schema Documentation

I'll analyze the project knowledge and prepare a list of JSON Schema files to generate for the System State Collector project.

Based on the documentation, this project collects various system state information and saves it in JSON files. Creating JSON Schema files would be valuable for validating the structure of these files and providing documentation for developers working with the collected data.

## Recommended JSON Schema Files to Generate

1. **metadata.json Schema**

   - Validates the metadata file that contains basic snapshot information
   - Includes fields like Timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, OSVersion, SnapshotDate

2. **index.json Schema**

   - Validates the index file that provides a map of all collected data files
   - Maps collector names to their corresponding JSON files

3. **Path.json Schema**

   - Validates PATH environment variable data
   - Includes path strings and existence status

4. **InstalledPrograms.json Schema**

   - Validates installed software information
   - Includes program names, publishers, versions, and install dates

5. **RunningServices.json Schema**

   - Validates information about active Windows services
   - Includes service names, display names, and startup types

6. **DiskSpace.json Schema**

   - Validates storage volume information
   - Includes drive names, free space, total space, and usage percentages

7. **PerformanceData.json Schema**

   - Validates system performance metrics
   - Includes CPU usage and memory utilization

8. **NetworkData.json Schema**

   - Validates network configuration and connections
   - Includes adapters, IP configurations, active connections, and DNS settings

9. **EnvironmentData.json Schema**

   - Validates environment variables
   - Includes system, user, and process-level variables

10. **RegistrySettings.json Schema**

    - Validates captured registry settings
    - Includes Windows settings, security settings, startup entries, and file associations

11. **Browsers.json Schema**

    - Validates browser installation and extension data
    - Includes browser versions, locations, and extensions/add-ons

12. **PythonInstallations.json Schema**

    - Validates Python environment information
    - Includes installations, virtual environments, and package managers

13. **WindowsFeatures.json Schema**

    - Validates Windows optional component data
    - Includes feature names, states, and descriptions

14. **WindowsUpdates.json Schema**

    - Validates Windows update history and settings
    - Includes installed updates and update configuration

15. **ScheduledTasks.json Schema**

    - Validates task scheduler information
    - Includes task names, states, schedules, and trigger information

16. **StartupPrograms.json Schema**

    - Validates autostart program data
    - Includes startup entries, locations, and commands

17. **Drivers.json Schema**

    - Validates device driver information
    - Includes device names, versions, manufacturers, and signature status

18. **Fonts.json Schema**
    - Validates installed font information
    - Includes font names, paths, and types

These schemas would provide a complete validation framework for all the data collected by the System State Collector. Each schema should follow the documented structure in the corresponding module documentation and incorporate the appropriate data types, required fields, and constraints.
